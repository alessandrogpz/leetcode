# Explanation of Approach

## Overview

The problem requires determining if a given string containing only `()[]{}` is **valid**, meaning:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of bracket.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket must have a corresponding open bracket.

### Key Observations:

- A valid string cannot start with a closing bracket.
- A valid string cannot have more closing brackets than opening ones at any point.
- The **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** property of a stack is well-suited for this problem.

## Approach: Using a Stack

### Key Idea

- Use a **stack** to keep track of open brackets.
- **Push** open brackets (`(`, `{`, `[`).
- On encountering a closing bracket (`)`, `}`, `]`), **check the top of the stack**:
  - If it matches the corresponding opening bracket, **pop** it.
  - If not (or if the stack is empty), return `false`.
- At the end, if the stack is empty, the string is valid.

### Steps:

1. **Initialize an empty stack**.
2. **Iterate through the string**:
   - If it's an **opening bracket**, push it onto the stack.
   - If it's a **closing bracket**:
     - If the stack is empty, return `false` (nothing to match).
     - If the top of the stack is the matching opening bracket, pop it.
     - Otherwise, return `false`.
3. **Return `true` if the stack is empty**, otherwise return `false`.

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the length of the string (each character is processed once).
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(N)\) in the worst case (if all characters are opening brackets).

## Alternative Implementation: `isValid_myImplementation`

This implementation follows the same logic as `isValid`:

- It **iterates** through the string.
- It **pushes open brackets** onto the stack.
- It **checks and pops matching pairs**.
- At the end, the **stack must be empty** for a valid string.

### Edge Cases Considered:

- **Single valid pairs:** `"()"`, `"{}"`, `"[]"`.
- **Multiple valid pairs:** `"()[]{}"`, `"({[]})"`.
- **Nested brackets:** `"({[]})"`.
- **Incorrectly ordered pairs:** `"(]"`, `"{(})"`.
- **Extra closing bracket:** `"(())]"`, `"(()"`.

## Helper Function: `iterateString`

- This function simply **iterates through a string** and prints each character.
- While not directly related to validation, it helps in debugging.

## Summary

| Approach                               | Pros                                           | Cons                             |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Stack-based solution**               | Efficient, clear logic, linear time complexity | Uses extra space for the stack   |
| **Brute-force comparisons (not used)** | Would be inefficient                           | Requires checking all substrings |

The stack-based solution is **optimal** and widely used for similar problems involving **parentheses validation**.
