The approach works by leveraging the fact that two strings can be made "close" only if they meet two conditions:

1. **Identical Set of Unique Characters**:  
   Since you cannot introduce a new character through any of the allowed operations, both strings must contain the same characters. This is checked by building a set of characters for each string and ensuring they are equal.

2. **Same Frequency Distribution (Up to Permutation)**:  
   Although the characters can be swapped and their frequencies interchanged, the overall collection of frequency counts (i.e., the multiset of counts) must be the same in both strings. To verify this, you:
   - Count the frequency of each character in both strings using a hash map.
   - Extract the frequency counts into two vectors.
   - Sort these vectors and compare them. If they match, it means that even if the characters are distributed differently, their frequencies can be rearranged to make the strings identical via the allowed operations.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Build Frequency Maps and Unique Character Sets**:

   - For each string (`word1` and `word2`), iterate over every character.
   - Increment its count in an `unordered_map<char, int>`.
   - Insert the character into an `unordered_set<char>` to track the unique characters.

2. **Compare Unique Characters**:

   - If the sets of unique characters from both strings are not equal, return `false` immediately.

3. **Extract and Sort Frequency Distributions**:

   - Iterate over the frequency maps to extract the counts into two separate vectors.
   - Sort both vectors of frequency counts.
   - Compare the sorted vectors element by element. If they are identical, then one string's frequencies can be rearranged to match the other's.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - If both the unique character sets and the sorted frequency vectors match, the strings are "close" (return `true`); otherwise, return `false`.

### Time Complexity Analysis

- **Building Frequency Maps and Sets**:  
  You iterate over each character of the strings, which takes **O(n)** time (where _n_ is the length of the string). Since each insertion or update in the map and set is O(1) on average, this step is linear.

- **Extracting Frequency Counts**:  
  There are at most 26 unique characters (since the strings contain only lowercase letters). Extracting these counts takes O(26) time, which is effectively constant.

- **Sorting the Frequency Vectors**:  
  Sorting vectors that contain at most 26 elements takes **O(26 log 26)** time, which is also constant relative to the size of the input strings.

- **Overall Time Complexity**:  
  The dominant factor is the initial traversal of the strings, leading to an overall time complexity of **O(n)**.

### Summary

The approach efficiently checks if two strings can be transformed into one another by:

- Ensuring both have the same unique characters.
- Verifying that the frequency distributions can be permuted to match each other.

Since the main work is done in a single pass over the input strings and the additional steps are on a fixed, small-size data set, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.
