# Approach Explanation: Implementing `strStr` Using `std::string::find`

## Overview

The problem requires finding the first occurrence of a substring (`needle`) in a given string (`haystack`). If `needle` exists within `haystack`, the function should return its starting index; otherwise, it should return `-1`.

## Key Idea

The solution leverages the C++ Standard Library's `std::string::find` method, which is designed to search for a substring within a string. This built-in function simplifies the implementation since it handles the search internally and efficiently.

## Detailed Steps

1. **Call `std::string::find`:**

   - Use `haystack.find(needle)` to search for the substring `needle` within `haystack`.
   - `std::string::find` returns the index of the first occurrence if the substring is found.
   - If the substring is not found, it returns `std::string::npos`.

2. **Check the Result:**

   - Compare the returned value with `std::string::npos`.
   - If the value is not equal to `std::string::npos`, return the found index.
   - Otherwise, return `-1` to indicate that the substring was not found.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - The function directly returns the computed index or `-1` based on the check.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  The worst-case time complexity depends on the underlying implementation of `std::string::find`. Typically, it can be O(n\*m) in the worst case (where n is the length of `haystack` and m is the length of `needle`), but many library implementations use optimizations that perform better on average.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  O(1) extra space, since no additional data structures are used aside from the input strings and a few variables.

## Edge Cases Considered

- **Empty `needle`:**  
  By problem convention or the behavior of `std::string::find`, an empty `needle` may be defined to return 0 (indicating that an empty string is trivially found at the start). Ensure this behavior aligns with problem requirements.

- **`needle` Not Present:**  
  The function returns `-1` when `std::string::find` yields `std::string::npos`.

- **Multiple Occurrences:**  
  Only the index of the first occurrence is returned, as required.

## Summary

The provided solution efficiently implements the substring search by utilizing C++'s `std::string::find`. This approach minimizes manual coding of search algorithms while ensuring that the problem constraints are met. The simplicity of the method makes the code easy to understand and maintain, with the added benefit of leveraging well-optimized library functions.
