## Key Concepts

1. **Stack Data Structure**:  
   The solution leverages two stacks:

   - **Count Stack (`countStack`)**: This stores the numbers (i.e., the repeat count `k`) before encountering a `'['`.
   - **String Stack (`stringStack`)**: This stores the current accumulated string before entering a new bracketed context.

2. **Handling Nested Encodings**:  
   Nested encodings (e.g., `3[a2[c]]`) require that the inner encoded strings be fully decoded before they can be used to build the outer string. Stacks help in saving the context (both the current string and the current repeat count) at each level of nesting.

## Detailed Approach

1. **Initialize Variables**:

   - `current`: A string that keeps track of the currently processed substring.
   - `k`: An integer to accumulate the digits for the repeat count.
   - Two stacks: one for counts (`countStack`) and one for strings (`stringStack`).

2. **Iterate Through Each Character in the Input String**:

   - **Digit (`0-9`)**:
     - Multiply `k` by 10 and add the current digit. This is to handle multi-digit numbers.
     - Example: For `"12[a]"`, processing `'1'` then `'2'` sets `k` to `12`.
   - **Opening Bracket (`'['`)**:
     - Push the current `k` onto `countStack` and the current string (`current`) onto `stringStack`.
     - Reset `current` to an empty string and `k` to `0` to prepare for processing the new encoded section.
   - **Closing Bracket (`']'`)**:
     - Pop the last repeat count from `countStack` and the last saved string from `stringStack`.
     - Repeat the `current` string `repeatTimes` (the popped number) times.
     - Append the repeated string to the saved string from `stringStack`, and update `current` with this combined string.
     - This mechanism ensures that nested patterns are correctly expanded and then integrated back into the overall decoded string.
   - **Alphabetical Character**:
     - Simply append the character to the `current` string.

3. **Return the Final Decoded String**:
   - After processing all characters, the variable `current` holds the fully decoded string, which is returned as the output.

## Step-by-Step Example

Let’s go through the input `"3[a2[c]]"`:

1. **Initialization**:

   - `current = ""`, `k = 0`, stacks are empty.

2. **Processing `'3'`**:

   - `k = 3`

3. **Processing `'['`**:

   - Push `k (3)` to `countStack` and `current ("")` to `stringStack`.
   - Reset `k = 0`, `current = ""`.

4. **Processing `'a'`**:

   - Append to `current`: `current = "a"`.

5. **Processing `'2'`**:

   - `k = 2`

6. **Processing `'['`**:

   - Push `k (2)` to `countStack` and `current ("a")` to `stringStack`.
   - Reset `k = 0`, `current = ""`.

7. **Processing `'c'`**:

   - Append to `current`: `current = "c"`.

8. **Processing `']'`**:

   - Pop `repeatTimes = 2` from `countStack`.
   - Pop previous string `"a"` from `stringStack`.
   - Build decoded string: repeat `"c"` 2 times → `"cc"`.
   - Update `current = "a" + "cc" = "acc"`.

9. **Processing `']'`**:

   - Pop `repeatTimes = 3` from `countStack`.
   - Pop previous string `""` (empty string) from `stringStack`.
   - Build decoded string: repeat `"acc"` 3 times → `"accaccacc"`.
   - Update `current = "" + "accaccacc" = "accaccacc"`.

10. **Final Output**:
    - The final decoded string is `"accaccacc"`.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:  
  The algorithm processes each character of the string once, leading to a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string.

- **Space Complexity**:  
  In the worst-case scenario (e.g., deeply nested encoded strings), the space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the use of stacks to store intermediate states.

---

## Summary

The approach efficiently decodes the string by:

- Using two stacks to manage the context of nested encoded strings.
- Processing each character sequentially and updating the current string or managing stacks when encountering brackets.
- Handling multi-digit numbers seamlessly.

This stack-based solution is straightforward and handles nested structures naturally, ensuring correct decoding of any valid input string as per the problem constraints.
