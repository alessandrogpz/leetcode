### Step 1: Understand the Problem

The string `x` divides another string `s` if `s` can be constructed by concatenating `x` multiple times. For example:

- `"AB"` divides `"ABAB"` because `"ABAB" = "AB" + "AB"`.
- `"AB"` does not divide `"ABA"` because `"ABA"` cannot be constructed using `"AB"`.

For two strings, the **greatest common divisor (GCD)** is the largest string `x` that divides both.

### Step 2: Observations

1. If the strings do not share the same starting pattern, the result is `""` (no common divisor). For example:
   - `"LEET"` and `"CODE"` share no pattern, so the result is `""`.
2. If `str1 + str2 != str2 + str1`, then no valid `x` exists, because their concatenation order should not matter for a divisor.

### Step 3: Relate to GCD of Lengths

The GCD of two strings is tied to the GCD of their lengths:

- Let `len1 = str1.length` and `len2 = str2.length`.
- The length of the GCD string `x` must divide both `len1` and `len2`.

Once you find `gcd(len1, len2)`, the first `gcd(len1, len2)` characters of `str1` (or `str2`, since both should be equivalent) is a candidate for `x`. Verify if this substring divides both strings.

### Step 4: Approach

1. **Check for Concatenation Order**:
   - If `str1 + str2 != str2 + str1`, return `""`.
2. **Compute GCD of Lengths**:
   - Use the `std::gcd` function in C++ or implement the Euclidean algorithm.
3. **Construct and Verify**:
   - Extract the substring of length `gcd(len1, len2)` from `str1` and check if it divides both `str1` and `str2`.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Input: `str1 = "ABCABC"`, `str2 = "ABC"`

1. Check: `str1 + str2 == "ABCABCABC"`, `str2 + str1 == "ABCABCABC"` -> Valid.
2. Compute: `gcd(len1, len2) = gcd(6, 3) = 3`.
3. Candidate: First `3` characters of `str1` -> `"ABC"`.
4. Verify: `"ABC"` divides both `"ABCABC"` and `"ABC"`.

Result: `"ABC"`.
