# Explanation of Approach

## Overview

The problem requires us to find the longest common prefix among a given list of strings. If there is no common prefix, we return an empty string (`""`).

**Key Observations:**

- If there is only one string, the common prefix is the string itself.
- If any string in the list is empty, the common prefix is `""`.
- The common prefix cannot be longer than the shortest string in the list.

## Approach 1: **Character-by-Character Matching**

### longestCommonPrefix()

### Key Idea

- The algorithm iterates character by character across all strings, ensuring that each character in the current position is the same for all strings.
- The process continues until a mismatch is found or the smallest string is fully traversed.

### Steps:

1. **Find the length of the smallest string** to set an upper limit for prefix comparison.
2. **Iterate character by character**, comparing each character of the first string with the corresponding character in all other strings:
   - If all strings have the same character at the current index, add it to the prefix.
   - If a mismatch is found, break the loop.
3. **Return the accumulated prefix**.

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N \times M)\), where \(N\) is the number of strings and \(M\) is the length of the smallest string.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) since no extra storage is used.

## Approach 2: **Comparing with the First String (Alternative)**

### longestCommonPrefix_1

### Key Idea:

- Instead of checking character by character for all strings at once, we compare the **first string** with each of the other strings and find the common prefix length.

### Steps:

1. **Initialize `ans` as the length of the first string**.
2. **Iterate through the remaining strings**:
   - Compare character by character and update `ans` to the length of the common prefix found.
   - If `ans` becomes `0`, return `""` immediately.
3. **Return the common prefix substring** of the first string up to index `ans`.

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N \times M)\), where \(N\) is the number of strings and \(M\) is the length of the shortest string.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as it only modifies indices and does not allocate extra storage.

## Comparison of Approaches

| Approach                            | Pros                                                          | Cons                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Character-by-Character Matching** | Easy to understand, works well for small inputs               | May perform unnecessary checks when a mismatch is found early |
| **First String Comparison**         | Efficient in practice, terminates early if no prefix is found | Still requires checking each string                           |

Both approaches have the same theoretical time complexity, but **Approach 2 is often faster in practice** as it terminates earlier when there is no common prefix.

## Edge Cases Considered:

- **Single String Input:** If only one string is given, return it.
- **Empty String in List:** If any string is empty, return `""`.
- **No Common Prefix:** If the first characters already differ, return `""` early.
- **All Strings Identical:** The result should be the full string itself.
- **Large Inputs:** The algorithm should efficiently handle up to 200 strings of length 200.
