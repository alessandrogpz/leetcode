# Approach Explanation: Container With Most Water

## Overview

The goal of this problem is to determine the maximum amount of water that can be contained between two vertical lines, where the water volume is limited by the shorter line. The array `height` represents the height of the lines positioned at each index. The volume (or area) is computed as the product of the distance between two lines and the height of the shorter line.

## Key Observations

- **Area Calculation:**  
  For any two lines at positions `i` and `j` with heights `height[i]` and `height[j]`, the area is given by:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \min(\text{height}[i], \text{height}[j]) \times (j - i)
  \]
  The area is constrained by the shorter of the two lines.

- **Two-Pointer Technique:**
  - Start with two pointers: one at the beginning (`L_POS`) and one at the end (`R_POS`) of the array.
  - The initial container spans the widest possible distance.
  - To potentially find a larger container, move the pointer at the shorter line inward. This is because the area is limited by the shorter line, and moving the longer line inward cannot improve the area.

## Detailed Steps

1. **Initialization:**

   - Set `L_POS` to `0` (the leftmost index).
   - Set `R_POS` to `height.size() - 1` (the rightmost index).
   - Initialize `MAX_VOLUME` to `0` to keep track of the maximum area found.

2. **Iterative Process:**

   - While `L_POS` is less than `R_POS`:

     - Retrieve `L_HEIGHT` from `height[L_POS]` and `R_HEIGHT` from `height[R_POS]`.
     - Calculate the current area (`CURRENT_VOLUME`) as:
       \[
       \text{`CURRENT\_VOLUME`} = \min(\text{`L\_HEIGHT`}, \text{`R\_HEIGHT`}) \times (\text{`R\_POS`} - \text{`L\_POS`})
       \]

     - Update `MAX_VOLUME` if `CURRENT_VOLUME` is greater than the current `MAX_VOLUME`.
     - Move the pointer corresponding to the shorter line:
       - If `L_HEIGHT < R_HEIGHT`, increment `L_POS`.
       - Otherwise, decrement `R_POS`.

3. **Return Result:**
   - After the loop terminates, `MAX_VOLUME` contains the maximum area that can be achieved.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  The algorithm runs in \(O(n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `height` array. Each element is processed at most once.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  The solution uses \(O(1)\) extra space as it only employs a fixed number of variables.

## Conclusion

This two-pointer approach efficiently finds the maximum area by continuously updating the candidate container and reducing the search space based on the limiting height. It guarantees the optimal solution in linear time without requiring additional memory.
